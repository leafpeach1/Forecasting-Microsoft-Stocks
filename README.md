I aim to analyze the trend of high prices over the course of 365 days. By using historical data and regression analysis, I plan to provide an accurate description for traders who are considering buying. 
One of the key questions I will answer is: What is the highest possible price at which they can sell?

 Furthermore, I will explore how these trends can inform trading strategies and decision-making steps. I hope to provide insights into the dynamics of the market.

The models used were regression models, univariate models, autocorrelation procedure, and moving average.
